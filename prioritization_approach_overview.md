# Prioritization Approach Overview for Stakeholders

## Objective:
We need a structured and visually clear overview of our tasks (user stories/features) for the upcoming prioritization sessions with stakeholders. This overview should help us focus on what’s most critical, while making sure we justify the rationale behind each task’s placement in the priority list.

## Prioritization Dimensions and Rationale:

### 1. Category (Importance to the Business):
- **A (Mandatory for productive use):** Highest priority (Factor = 3)
  - **Why:** These features are essential for the system to be productive and usable. They directly impact the go-live or the ability to perform core functions. Without them, the system will not meet the minimum functional requirements.
- **B (Automation and efficiency improvement, operational ROI):** Medium priority (Factor = 2)
  - **Why:** Automation improves operational efficiency, reduces manual effort, and brings return on investment (ROI). These features are critical for long-term success and sustainability but may not be blockers for immediate productive use.
- **C (Convenience and ease of use, good learnability):** Lower priority (Factor = 1)
  - **Why:** These features enhance the user experience, making the product easier to use and more intuitive. While valuable for end-users, they are not immediately required to meet the core business goals, making them a lower priority.

### 2. Technical Impact:
- **Yes (Significant technical impact – breaking changes, security issues, data schema changes):** Higher priority (Factor = 2)
  - **Why:** Changes with significant technical impact have cascading effects across the system (e.g., breaking changes, security fixes, data migrations). Ignoring them could introduce major risks, causing system failures or making future work exponentially harder.
- **No (No significant technical impact):** Lower priority (Factor = 1)
  - **Why:** If a task does not influence the system’s core technical architecture, it poses less risk and urgency. These features can be introduced without the fear of disrupting the overall system.

### 3. Effort (T-shirt sizes for estimation):
- **XS (Minimal effort):** 1 point (Factor = 1)
- **S (Small effort):** 2 points (Factor = 2)
- **M (Medium effort):** 3 points (Factor = 3)
- **L (Large effort):** 5 points (Factor = 5)
- **XL (Extreme effort):** 8 points (Factor = 8)
  - **Why:** Higher effort tasks typically introduce more complexity and have greater dependencies. These should be tackled earlier because:
    1. They carry more **unknowns** and potential risks that could grow over time.
    2. Large efforts often need more coordination across teams and resources. Delaying them can cause future bottlenecks, whereas completing them early avoids last-minute surprises.
    3. Large tasks usually involve more **integration points** that affect multiple parts of the system. Handling them early ensures smoother integration with smaller, subsequent tasks.

### 4. Uncertainty:
- **Low (Clear understanding):** Highest confidence (Factor = 3)
  - **Why:** Tasks with a clear scope and understanding should be prioritized because they have fewer unknowns and can be tackled with high confidence. These are "ready-to-go" and allow us to proceed without waiting for further clarification.
- **Mid (Some unclear aspects):** Medium confidence (Factor = 2)
  - **Why:** These tasks still need some clarifications but are not overly ambiguous. Prioritizing them early allows us to resolve uncertainties before they become blockers.
- **High (Needs more exploration, too fluffy):** Lowest confidence (Factor = 1)
  - **Why:** Tasks with high uncertainty should not be prioritized too early, as they often require additional discovery, research, or clarification. Prioritizing these prematurely may lead to rework or delays as more details surface later. It's better to let them mature before proceeding.

## Priority Calculation:

To create a structured prioritization, we will **sum** the factors from each dimension to generate a prioritization score for each task:

```
Priority Score = Category + Technical Impact + Effort + Uncertainty
```

This sum-based prioritization ensures we account for both business needs and technical complexities, creating a balanced and clear list of priorities.

## Rationale for the Sum-Based Approach:

- **Balanced Contribution**: Each factor (category, technical impact, effort, uncertainty) plays an important role in determining the priority. By summing the values, we ensure each dimension is weighed equally and that no single aspect dominates the prioritization process.
- **Effort-Driven Prioritization**: Higher effort tasks are given more weight because their complexity, dependencies, and risks are greater. Addressing these early ensures smoother integration and reduces potential future issues.
- **Clarity on Readiness**: Tasks with low uncertainty and high clarity should be handled earlier to keep momentum and avoid unnecessary delays. Fluffy, unclear tasks can be addressed later once they’re better understood.
