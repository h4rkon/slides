| Cost Category           | Cloud Provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)               | Databricks                                        |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Delta Lake (Open Source)** | - Infrastructure and operations costs<br>- No licensing costs for core Delta Lake  | - No direct cost for Delta Lake itself<br>- Costs are more associated with Databricks platform usage |
| **Databricks Delta**    | - Not applicable (specific to Databricks)           | - VM/node costs based on size & number<br>- Potential performance optimizations may affect compute costs |
| **Storage Costs**       | - Storage costs (e.g., S3, ADLS)<br>- Versioning costs (if enabled) | - Similar storage costs, but with potential optimizations based on Databricks' optimizations |
| **Compute Costs**       | - Compute costs for running Spark clusters or other compute services | - VM/node costs based on cluster size & number<br>- Potential cost savings from optimized performance |
| **Networking Costs**    | - Data transfer costs, especially cross-region or external transfers | - Similar networking costs, but also costs for transferring data to/from Databricks environment |
| **Backup and Redundancy** | - Costs for additional storage<br>- Data replication costs | - Backup and redundancy within Databricks environment may have associated costs |
| **Tooling and Integration** | - Costs for additional services/tools integrated with Delta Lake | - Potential costs/savings based on Databricks' integrated tooling |
| **Support and Operations** | - Costs for managed services, support, or operational tools | - Possible additional costs for Databricks support and premium offerings |
