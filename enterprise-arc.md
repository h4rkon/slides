# Enterprise Architecture: Structuring into Domains and Subdomains

Creating an overview of an enterprise's architecture, including its domains and subdomains, is a fundamental step in understanding and managing the complex structure of an organization. This process involves several key steps:

## Define the Scope and Objectives
- Determine the goals of the enterprise architecture.
- Identify the areas of focus, such as alignment of IT with business goals or improving process efficiency.

## Gather Information
- Collect data from various sources within the organization.
- Engage with stakeholders to understand processes and technology usage.

## Identify Domains
- Break down the enterprise into core domains like Business Architecture, Data Architecture, Application Architecture, and Technology Architecture.

## Define Subdomains
- Identify subdomains within each domain.
- Document key components, processes, systems, and technologies in each subdomain.

## Create a Domain Map
- Develop a visual representation of these domains and subdomains.
- Use tools like Enterprise Architecture software for this purpose.

## Conduct Gap Analysis
- Compare the current state with the desired future state.
- Identify gaps in capabilities, processes, or technologies.

## Develop a Roadmap
- Create a plan for bridging identified gaps.
- Include initiatives, resource allocation, and timelines.

## Implement Governance
- Establish processes for maintaining and updating the enterprise architecture.
- Ensure compliance with standards.

## Review and Update Regularly
- Regularly revisit and revise the enterprise architecture.
- Reflect changes in business strategy, technology, and market trends.

Remember, the key to a successful enterprise architecture overview is collaboration across different departments and stakeholders, and tailoring the approach to the specific needs and context of your organization.

# Driving Questions for Identifying Domains and Subdomains

To effectively identify domains and subdomains in an enterprise, specific driving questions can guide the analysis. These questions are categorized by the main domains:

- What are the key business processes, and how do they align with the company's strategy?

## Data Architecture
- What types of data (patient, research, regulatory) does the company manage?
- How is data collected, stored, and utilized across different departments?
- What are the data governance and compliance requirements?

## Application Architecture
- What software applications are currently in use, and for what purposes?
- How do these applications support business processes and decision-making?
- Are there any gaps or redundancies in the application landscape?

- What is the current state of the IT infrastructure (hardware, networks, cloud services)?
- How does the technology infrastructure support the operational needs of the business?
- What are the cybersecurity measures in place to protect sensitive data?

## Product Development
- What are the key products and services offered by the company?
- How is the product development process structured, from concept to market?

## Compliance and Quality Assurance
- What are the regulatory requirements the company must adhere to?
- How does the company ensure product quality and safety?
- What are the processes for internal audits and compliance reporting?

These questions are designed to uncover detailed insights into each domain and subdomain, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the enterprise's architecture.
