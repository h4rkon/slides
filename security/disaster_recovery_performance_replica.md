# Disaster Recovery and Performance Replica Strategy in Azure

## The Scenarios

### 1. Primary Data Center Outage
- **Description**: The primary Vault cluster in Data Center 1 (DC1) becomes unavailable due to hardware failure, power outage, or network issues.
- **Mitigation**: Promote the D/R replica in Data Center 2 (DC2) to primary status.

### 2. Total On-Premise Outage
- **Description**: Simultaneous failures in both on-premises data centers (DC1 and DC2), possibly due to regional disasters.
- **Mitigation**: Promote the D/R replica in Azure to primary role.

### 3. Azure Region Outage
- **Description**: The Azure region hosting the performance and D/R replicas experiences an outage.
- **Mitigation**: Operations continue with the unaffected on-premises primary and D/R replicas. Implement multi-region strategy in Azure for resilience.

### 4. Network Partition
- **Description**: Network partition prevents communication between on-premises data centers and Azure.
- **Mitigation**: On-premises clusters operate independently until connectivity is restored.

### 5. Cyber Attack or Security Breach
- **Description**: A cybersecurity event compromises the integrity or availability of the Vault setup.
- **Mitigation**: Isolate affected clusters, promote a secure D/R replica to primary, and restore data from backups.

## The Significance of Having a D/R Replica Next to Performance Replica in Azure

- **Geographical Redundancy**: Offers protection against regional-specific disasters, providing an extra layer of resilience.
- **Cloud Flexibility and Scalability**: Enables easy scaling and adjustment in crisis or recovery phases.
- **Operational Resilience**: Ensures continuity of operations with an additional backup layer.
- **Testing and Maintenance**: Facilitates safe testing and disaster recovery drills without impacting primary operations.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps in meeting regulatory requirements for disaster recovery capabilities.

## Mitigation and Preparedness Strategies

- **Regular Failover Drills**: Conduct simulations to ensure preparedness for various scenarios.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for early detection and response.
- **Backup and Recovery Procedures**: Maintain up-to-date backups and test recovery processes regularly.
- **Security Posture**: Continuously update security practices to defend against cyber threats.
