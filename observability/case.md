## Current Setup
- **Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Architecture:** The system encompasses multiple clouds (AWS, Azure) and includes on-premise infrastructure, crucial for managing connectivity between cars and backend applications/services across multiple regions due to both proximity considerations and regulatory compliance.

## Strategy Overview
- **Core Requirement:** Establish a centralized observability platform that incorporates the following key aspects:
  - **Unified Instrumentation:** Standardize data collection across diverse environments to ensure consistent and comprehensive monitoring.
  - **Centralized Data Aggregation:** Consolidate data from various sources into a single system to enable integrated analysis and access.
  - **Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement systems capable of processing and analyzing data in real-time to swiftly identify and address issues.
  - **Advanced Visualization Tools:** Utilize sophisticated tools for visualizing complex datasets and system states to aid in decision-making.
  - **Feedback Loops for Continuous Improvement:** Set up mechanisms to continuously collect and utilize system feedback to enhance functionality and performance.

## Objectives and Quality Requirements
- **Performance:** Ensure real-time responsiveness in data processing and analysis to detect and manage issues faster than they can impact user experiences.
- **Integrability:** Facilitate seamless integration of both current and future tools within the system, allowing for scalability and updates without disrupting ongoing operations.
- **Scale:** Design the system to efficiently handle significant increases in data volume, preparing to manage over 36 billion messages per day.

## Constraints
- **Business Continuity:** Develop the new system in parallel with existing operations, implementing a gradual migration strategy to maintain continuity.
- **Tool Flexibility:** Prefer tools that are cloud provider agnostic, prioritizing open-source solutions, or, if necessary, developing custom tools tailored to specific requirements.
- **Data Retention and Storage:** Address the limitations in current tools that offer only short-term data storage (15 to 30 days), necessitating a solution capable of more extended data storage for comprehensive analysis and regulatory compliance.

## Solution Outline
- **Globally Spanning Streaming Platform:** Consider the deployment of a streaming platform that operates across multiple regions and cloud environments, which will form the infrastructure backbone for data transmission.
- **Central Analytics Platform:** Utilize this data in a central analytics platform that performs extensive analytics, supports real-time operational needs, and facilitates deeper insights through machine learning for predictive maintenance and decision-making.

## Integration of Existing Tools
- **Initial Considerations:**
  - **Evaluate Current Tools:** Assess the capabilities and limitations of current tools like DataDog, Dynatrace, and Prometheus. Determine their fit within the new observability framework based on criteria such as scalability, integration flexibility, and feature set.
  - **Integration vs. Replacement:** Decide on whether to integrate existing tools in the initial phase or to phase them out in favor of more scalable and integrated solutions. This decision should be based on factors such as the criticality of current functionality provided by these tools, their cloud agnosticism, and cost implications.

- **Strategic Integration Approach:**
  - **Phased Integration:** If existing tools are to be maintained:
    - Integrate these tools early in the deployment of the new platform to leverage their established capabilities and ensure no loss of functionality.
    - Use adapter layers or middleware to connect these tools with the new data streaming platform, ensuring data consistency and minimizing integration overhead.
  - **Gradual Replacement:** If replacement is preferred:
    - Develop a roadmap for gradually phasing out existing tools, aligning with the deployment milestones of the new platform.
    - Introduce new tools in a staged manner, starting with non-critical functions to test and refine their performance within the new environment.

## Business Continuity
- **Maintaining Operational Integrity:**
  - **Parallel Operations:** Run the new observability platform in parallel with the existing setup. This dual-running phase is crucial to ensure that all system functionalities remain operational and that data integrity is maintained throughout the transition.
  - **Minimize Disruption:** Implement new updates and integrations during off-peak hours or in staged environments to minimize impact on live operations.

- **Data Migration and Management:**
  - **Data Synchronization:** Keep data synchronized between old and new systems during the transition period to prevent data loss or discrepancies.
  - **Legacy Data Handling:** Develop strategies for migrating historical data to the new platform or ensure that it remains accessible for necessary analytics and compliance requirements.

- **Testing and Validation:**
  - **Comprehensive Testing:** Conduct extensive testing of the new platform to ensure it meets all operational, performance, and security standards before fully transitioning from old systems.
  - **Feedback Loops:** Establish feedback mechanisms to quickly identify and rectify any issues that arise during the integration of the new system, using insights from both system performance data and user reports.

## Monitoring and Evaluation
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring strategies to oversee the performance of both the old and new systems during the transition. This includes real-time monitoring of system health, performance metrics, and user activity to detect potential issues early.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Set clear benchmarks and criteria for the success of the new platform, including performance metrics, user satisfaction, and return on investment. These criteria will help in determining the right time to fully switch over to the new platform and decommission old tools.
